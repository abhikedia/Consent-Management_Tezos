This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About Project
This project is about Consent Management. When we book a flight ticket, our details are sold by the airline or the booking platform and we receive unnecessary emails and texts which also is a violation of our privacy. <br/>
This platform allows users to book their ticket without their information visible directly to the airline. They have the option to contact you anonymously(just like uber makes calls without showing driver's number and hiding your's as well).<br/>
When the flight is complete, the user has the option to raise their consent and avoid any future communication from the airline.

## How does it work?
The users data is encrypted and stored in swarm(which is a decentralised storage by ethereum). The id generated by swarm is uploaded to blockchain. <br.>
When the passenger makes the booking, the airline's address is added to the list who have the access to the encrypted data via blockchain. The id generated by swarm is first encrypted with airline's public key which ensures that the airline cannot forward the information to any third party. <br/>
When the airline wants to contact the passenger, say send a message, they have to login to their platform and select the passenger, then on a button's click, firstly the airline's credibility of accessing the information is checked and then passenger's contact is retrieved without making it visible to the airline. <br/>
Once the flight is over, the user can login and revoke airline's access to his data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
